# CS350Client-ServerDevelopment
full stack app using mongoDB, python, jupyter notebook, dash leaflet, panda

class project that uses an animal database for a customer to more efficiently find breeds of dogs for life saving rescue operations.  
Utilizes mongoDB, python, jupyter notebook, dash leaflet, and panda.  
AnimalShelterCLass.py is an importable module for navigation CRUD operations.

Answers to questions:

[]How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
--ANSWER: The approach used in this project was to make AnimalShelterClass.py modular and portable, so that it was easy to include in later week's assignments.  By working in this way, it was easy to start an entirely different application and import over the CRUD functionality.

[]How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
--ANSWER: Start by understanding the requirements.  This class was complicated in a sense because so much of the code was written ahead of time and we had to understand where we were needed.  I made certain to add code and test regularly so that I did not have to wonder where a debug issue might be.  

[]What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
--ANSWER: Computer scientists use tools to solve problems.  The tools used here involved a way to Create, Read, Update, and Delete entries in an animal database, using a python glue to connect the user interface with background mongoDB.  A company like Grazioso Salvare is looking for a way to take large amounts of data and quickly sort through it, which this project does.
